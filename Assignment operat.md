# Assignment operator
#### Unlike Math, = is not for comparison. It is in fact used for assigning the value on the right side to the declared variable. You can declare a variable and assign a value at the same time:

#### var foo = 6;
#### You can also assign a value to an existing variable:

#### foo = 4; // change variable `foo`
#### Now try to run the following code on PythonTutor (Links to an external site.):

#### var name = 'Fido'; // A variable contains a string.
#### var age = 5; // A variable contains the number 5.
#### age = 6; // Assign a new value to the declared variable `age`.
